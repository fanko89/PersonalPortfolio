            <h3> Proximity </h3>
            <p> So, with proximity. I try to keep my pages looking similar by keeping the nav bar the same on 
              each page and keeping only a selection of colors. By keeping the background color red on each 
              page, this would help the confusing for the user wondering if they are still on the same website. 
              Another part was how I had the layout of each page follow a certain structure, like the head 
              going to the header and after the header is my nav bar and main to, lastly, the footer. By 
              keeping the proximity of each page looking closely related I have a high change of the user not 
              getting confused and leaving my website.</p>

          </iframe>
        </div>

        <h3> Alignment</h3>
        <p>The alignment on my webpage was decent. I keep make a nice red boarder wrapped around my 
          content with a little padding on each side of the content. When shrinking down the webpage to 
          mobile, my alignment adjusts to the width with my content not going out of alignment. There
          are a couple of areas I would like to fix like when the website is in mobile view the map moves 
          to its own column above the text instead of just smashing the text. Another part I need to work 
          on in alignment on my webpage is my paragraphs should be indented in form my headers, or 
          the other way around. I don’t like how most of all the text lines up and makes it look a little 
          boring.</p>


        <h3>Repetition</h3>
        <p>I feel like repetition is somewhat close to proximity in I make each page look similar and 
          repeated the same nav bar for each page of my website. Each page also repeated the same 
          type of structure on each page but repeating content that is important, an example being the 
          logo name and slogan. And my bottom footer is repeated in every page. Maybe adding social 
          media links with icons and repeating them on each page could be something I could do to 
          improve the site.</p>

          <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <p>Contrast is something that needs to be improved on my website. A lot of the pages looks very 
          similar and have the same font and colors, although this is a good thing to consider when 
          building a sight, it is also important to add contrast to each page. I need to make special
          sections and change around the website is light out. My shop and home webpage has an image 
          in the same location and doesn’t have a lot of contrast from each other. Maybe make the shop 
          page have boxes with different shopping items would be an improvement that would give it 
          more contrast.</p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <p>The websites typograph could use a little work but isn’t too bad. I have about 4-6 different font 
          sizes and might not need that many different ones. Sometimes changing too often can be a bad 
          thing. Another problem is my header font type is almost too hard to read. I need to make it a 
          little similar and maybe a san-serif type font would work better for visibility and keeping the 
          fonts similar to each other. Overall, my typography of my website looks good, but I might need 
          to make those changes to have it feel more like a business.</p>
