            <h1>Hey! Derek here.</h1>
            <p class="intro_text">I've been married for 9 years and have enjoyed every 
              minute of it. When I'm not spending time with my wife or 
              on the computer I'm working on a hobbie. One being a 
              1975 Voltswagon Transporter. Even though I enjoy new 
              technology, thereâ€™s something about diagnosing and 
              repairing somehting without the help of modern 
              technology. This gives me a greater appreciation for how 
              tecnology has advanced over the years since the vehicle 
              was developed. 
               Another Hobbie I enjoy is playing the piano or one of my 
              collection of synthesizers. I also love composing music 
              and use DAW or Music Notation software to get my 
              thoughts down. I've always had a passion for music and I 
              feel like it helps redue anxiety and strengthen my mental 
              alertness.<br>

                I decided to pick Web and Application Development as my 
main degree. I already hadsome experience in 
building websites and applications and always had a passion for 
design things. During my 
education in Web and Application Development, I learned how 
create different UX designs by implementing all types of 
color schemes, typograph, alignment, ext. to effectively 
appeal to the type of reader the design was intended for. 
Another part of my Web and Application Development 
degree was learning languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
and others to create fully functional websites. When 
creating the website either created my own framework or 
useing a already created one like bootstrap for grid layout for functionality.<br> 

  I also had the opportunity to learn about software development. 
During my education in Software Development, I Created a 
sort program using the LC3 that takes basic commands 
like ADD and coverts them to binary. To do this program we 
started all the way down to the computers transistors that 
creates binary and a how different notations like signed 
magnitude, 1s Complement and 2s Complement are used 
to take values and convert to binary for the computer to 
understand. This gave me a greater appreciation for 
assembly languages and how much code is used to do 
basic functions that high-level languages use so easily. 
When studying high level languages , I learned about the 
big O notation and how to use it to find the most efficient 
algorithm for the task at hand. I also deeper into the 
different types of sorting functions by creating my own 
that replicate most the built-in functions on high-level 
languages in return gave me new ways to manipulate these 
build-in functions to create unique ones for the tasks 
presented to me. Lastly, I had the chance to do a project 
that converted infixed, postfix and prefixed notations 
using stacks and how it is easier for the machines to read 
pre-postfix notations over infixed. These are just a few 
things in Software Development I have learned over my 
education that I found interesting.
